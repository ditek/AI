[2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) is a single-player sliding block puzzle game which objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.
